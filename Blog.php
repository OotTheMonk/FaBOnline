    <h2>Welcome Talishar.net üçæ</h2>
    <h3>Good morning #fabtcg player!<br>
      We are happy to present you
      <a class="talishar.net" href="http://Talishar.net">Talishar.net</a> üéâ
    </h3>
    <p>
      <br><br>We are slowly working our way through a rebranding. It's important for us that the players know we are a fan-made platform and not associated with LSS.
      LSS didn't contact us or asked us to make this change. It is our own decision and based on feedback we've received.
      We hope to stay engaged in the community and provide a tool for the players so they can make the most of the limited time when they play in person locally.‚ù§Ô∏è
      <br>We will soon start redirecting people to this new website. Normally the process should be done smoothly.
      <br><br>Thank you everyone and don't hesitate if you have any questions or feedback!

    <h3>üßë‚Äçüè≠ Hello #fabtcg players! Weekend's update just for you!</h3>

      <br>- Add confirmation that you rated a player.
      <br>- Fix karma limit to 0. The lower limit wasn't coded.
      <br>- Improve sink below + pummel logs. We now show in the chat log that a card has been sink or which card was discarded.
      <br>- Fix situations where Zen Token wasn't working as expected.
      <br>- Fix Valda/Shiyana not been affected by sleep dart.
      <br>- We added the newer English "Learn to Play" video on the main menu by @TowerNumberNine.
      <br>- Added badges to the winners of the commotion #1 challenge.
      <br>- Improved the highlighted tab in the sideboard.
      <br>- Fix Sonic Boom not showing the top card if unplayable.
      <br>- Fix the same frostbites getting destroyed multiple times, messing with the auras layout.
      <br>- Fix Spark of Genius dynamic cost getting messed up by CLF/Frostbites. It wasn't allowing you to search for a specific item.

    <h2>Reputation System</h2>
    <h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªHappy Sunday players!
      <br><br>We heard you! We worked this weekend on a better way to deal with leavers with a reputation system.
    </h3>
    <p><br>The system is a quick way to check if a player has a good reputation on Talishar (does not quit games, is friendly, plays fair).
      <br>Depending on your Karma score, you may also be allowed or not allowed to use some features or to join a given game.
      <br><br>Your initial Karma score is 75‚òØ Then:
      <br>&emsp;‚Ä¢ Each time you finish a game, you get +1‚òØ.
      <br>&emsp;‚Ä¢ If you quit a game in progress, you lose -10‚òØ.
      <br>&emsp;‚Ä¢ If you receive too many 'Red thumbs-down' from other players when compared to the amount of 'Green thumbs-up' received, your karma will be reduced each time you receive a Red Thumb.
      In this case, the best is to have a good behavior to get Green thumb and restore your ratio and reputation.
      <br><br>It also includes a new setting for game creation that allows you to restrict your game to people with decent/good karma.
      <br><br>We hope that this will improve your experience on the platform!
      <br>Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

    <h2>9th August 2022</h2>
    <h3>üéä Patreons Update!<br>
      We are happy to announce that we've added Patreon API integration to the website!
      The login with Patreon button is on the profile page. It comes with some brand new Patron-specific benefits:
    </h3>
    <p><br>&emsp;1. Heart of Fyendal icon shows up by your name in the chat
      <br>&emsp;2. Custom card backs (select in the menu)
      <br>&emsp;3. Ability to see your completed game stats for each hero on the profile page
      <br>&emsp;4. Ability to see the in-game stats page on any turn, instead of just at the end.
      <br><br>We've been growing a lot, so server costs should increase shortly. Then we'll be looking to save funds to re-invest in art assets for the site. We want to work on the game background to bring it closer to the standard of what you might expect for a digital card game.
      <br><br>The founder tier has been closed to new members, as it has said in the description. We always intended to close the Founder tier once we got to a point where we began adding Patreon benefits. We wanted them to have something extra special since they initially supported the site.
      <br><br>As such, you will note that the Founder discord role will no longer accept new members. I want to truly thank all the patrons that have supported us up to this point and look forward to continuing to work to improve the site together! ‚ù§Ô∏è
