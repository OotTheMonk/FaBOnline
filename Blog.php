    <h2>FaB Online Roadmap</h2>
    <h3>üìù We recently wrote a roadmap and thought it would be nice to share it with you to give you an idea of what we have planned for the long-term.
      We are overwhelmed by the recent boom that created our Twitter accounts. So many news bugs and features are coming our way. Thank you!</h3>
    <p><br>1. Top priority is fixing the major outstanding bugs/missing gameplay engine features, noted above
    <br>2. Updating the UI to be more interesting, user friendly, and intuitive
    <br>&emsp;- Dynamic scaling of UI to better account for a wide variety of monitor/resolution
    <br>&emsp;- Better mobile support
    <br>&emsp;- Better Settings menu
    <br>3. Streamlining the game to remove unnecessary clicks, and make every click meaningful
    <br>4. Ability to save favorite decks to your profile
    <br>5. Ability to see your historical matches/winrate
    <br>6. Tournament mode (disable undo hotkey/make undo and manual tools require opponent approval)
    <br>7. Better matchmaking
    <br>&emsp;- ‚ÄúQuick Start‚Äù button - Join or create, whatever is available
    <br>&emsp;- Karma system that gives points for finishing games and being a good sport, takes away points for ragequitting, joining lobbies and leaving, reports, etc.
    <br>&emsp;-  Ladder/League/ELO
    <br>&emsp;- Automated tournaments
    <br>8. Unity Client

    <h2>1st August 2022</h2>
    <h3>PSA for all players. We made a big update this morning with some visual changes. You will need to clear your browser cache to see all the changes.</h3>

      <br>- New pass animation.
      <br>- New button animation.
      <br>- Better error handling for deck link errors.
      <br>- New "Select" overlay.
      <br>- Rhinar intimidate when discarding from an ice card effect (e.g Winter's bite).
      <br>- Fix Rouse the Ancients showing "null" card and a popup when your hand is empty.
      <br>- Phantasmal Footsteps now properly get destroyed when blocking an attack that got buffed.

    <h2>29th July 2022</h2>
    <h3>Good morning!üëã</h3>
    <p><br>- Your deck list in limited is now sorted.
      <br>- The card highlighted colours are now improved and with the pitch number to better support colourblindness.
      <br>- You'll be able to respond to Seismic and Embodiment destruction.
