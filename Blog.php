    <h2>1st August 2022</h2>
    <h3>PSA for all players. We made a big update this morning with some visual changes. You will need to clear your browser cache to see all the changes.</h3>
    <p><br>- New combat chain animation.
      <br>- New pass animation.
      <br>- New button animation.
      <br>- Better error handling for deck link errors.
      <br>- New "Select" overlay.
      <br>- Rhinar intimidate when discarding from an ice card effect (e.g Winter's bite).
      <br>- Fix Rouse the Ancients showing "null" card and a popup when your hand is empty.
      <br>- Phantasmal Footsteps now properly get destroyed when blocking an attack that got buffed.
      <br>- Properly show the attack target when the target isn't a hero.
      <br>- We now group multiple effects from the same card (Fix for all cards). e.g Spoils of War give 2-3 effects. It was creating some confusion where people thought you had played a card twice.
      <br><br>Thank you all! ‚ù§Ô∏è

    <h2> 29st July 2022</h2>
    <h3>Good morning!üëã</h3>
    <p><br>- Your deck list in limited is now sorted.
      <br>- The card highlighted colours are now improved and with the pitch number to better support colourblindness.
      <br>- You'll be able to respond to Seismic and Embodiment destruction.
      <br>FYI: This update and the one from the last 2 days are being delayed. Mostly because the new code and BIG update for the triggers will break all the game in progress so we want to make it clean for the players. Thank you for your patience! üôÇ
